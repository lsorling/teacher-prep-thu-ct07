week 8 (mid-sem assessment)

with one hour to spare 
we continued with lesson 6 slides
stopped at collision and noLoop()

added game over message
display sprite as label using collider as "none"

added game start messsage
in the middle of the canvas - width/2
follow the camera, then use sprite.x = camera.x

end of class

a lot of content

ct07
#1
js function (with 0 parameter)

#2
bird moving right (similar to scratch)
camera to lock on bird.x

#3
visual debugging is so cool 
must teach text()

#4
if conditions to change bird img as animation with rotation


lesson 6 will need more time to explain
scrolling
why game is weird now 

also observe missing first set of pipes
but nevermind
-cos its used for teaching lesson 5
it served a purpose

explain % modulo symbol to find remainder when 2 numbers divide

yeah i fixed my bug
i had a line with bird.y = 200;
-now smooth tests

lesson 6
-using collision added game over
after game over, add start screen

observation:
already missing the first set of pipes 
so that frameCount === 1 is unnecessary

i made 3 mistakes till now

#1. frameCount spelled all small letters
#2. noLoop() spelled all small letters and the .ts helped me (problem with slide, not me)
#3. found 3rd mistake, midY for spawnPipePair is height -250;

lesson 5
intro group (of sprites)
added static pipe pair on the right side

lesson 4
once starting to code flappybird game
do in playground.js
then copy to flappybird.js to test
then do backup, ready for next lesson

teacher prep use chrome on my laptop

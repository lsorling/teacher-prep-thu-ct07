lesson 6
-using collision added game over
after game over, add start screen

observation:
already missing the first set of pipes 
so that frameCount === 1 is unnecessary

i made 3 mistakes till now

#1. frameCount spelled all small letters
#2. noLoop() spelled all small letters and the .ts helped me (problem with slide, not me)
#3. found 3rd mistake, midY for spawnPipePair is height -250;

lesson 5
